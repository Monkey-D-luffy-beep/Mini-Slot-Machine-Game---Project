# Mini-Slot-Machine-Game---Project
Slot Machine Game - Python Mini Project

Welcome to the Slot Machine Game, a fun and interactive mini-project developed in Python! This program simulates a simple slot machine where players can bet on multiple lines, spin the reels, and test their luck to win virtual money.

Features

Bet on up to 3 lines with a customizable bet amount.
A randomized slot machine with symbols like A, B, C, and D.
Calculate winnings based on matching symbols in the slot columns.
User-friendly interface with detailed messages for interaction.
Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

Python Functions: Modular design for better readability and reusability.
Control Structures: Using loops and conditionals for user interaction and game logic.
Data Structures: Implementing lists and dictionaries for storing symbols and values.
Random Module: Generating randomized slot machine spins.
Input Validation: Handling user input with error messages and constraints.
Basic Game Mechanics: Creating a working slot machine simulation.
How to Play?
Deposit an amount of virtual money to start.
Choose the number of lines to bet on (1 to 3).
Enter your bet amount per line.
Spin the slot machine and see if you win!
Keep playing until you decide to quit or run out of balance.
